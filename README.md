# This is my [personal blog](http://www.albertgao.xyz)

* blogs written down via markdown and sit in folder /source/\_posts

* will generate html by Hexo, but didn't include in this repo

* I backup it using 2 repos
  * one on my private server served as an automatic deployment bridge
  * one on github for the actual backup purpose
  * push up together via setting `.git/config`

Now I use the theme Next, which seems awesome, but not include in this repo.
I have fixed some bugs of the original theme, next, and have pulled request to do a little contribution.

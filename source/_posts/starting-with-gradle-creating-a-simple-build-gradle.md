`Gradle` is a famous building tool in `JVM` world. And a building tool is just a building tool, for setup your workflow. To automate things like building, linting, testing, pushing and much more to make your life easier. But sometimes it could be hard to grasp its idea. Even after reading the official documentation. Today let's up and running gradle within a few minutes.

<!--more-->

## 1. Some preknowledge of Gradle

Most of your `gradle` code will reside in the `build.gradle` file. And it's all about the configuration. How you want to build your work flow. And the things you want to execute is called `task` and will be implemented here. They are all written in a language called `groovy`.

Before you have this omg-new-language-just-for-building idea, read this quote from google official documentation:

> You donâ€™t need to know Groovy to start configuring your build because the Android plugin for Gradle introduces most of the DSL elements you need.

And it's a universal idea not only for android. Because most of the time, you don't need to implement your own task, there are `gradle plugins` which already finish writing these tasks for you. You just need to add those `plugin` as `dependencies` and put their `configuration blocks` here with your own values.

The ideas above should make the `build.gradle` file pretty easy to understand, because now its functionalities are narrowed down to only manage your `plugins` and project `dependencies`.

## 2. A practical workflow for working with `gradle`

So now you should have a clear workflow:

1. You pick up the `gradle plugins` you want.
2. You add them as `dependencies` and `apply` them, now you get the `gradle tasks`.
3. You can configure these `plugins` by adding their `configuration blocks` to your `build.gradle` file.
4. You then add the `dependencies` for your project.
5. You can configure your project information like `groupId`, `archiveBasename`, etc.
6. Happy gradle.

Let's try set up a `kotlin` project with `gradle`. How do we start? Well, from above we now know that we just need to find a plugin which implements kotlin related tasks for us. And, we will use the official `kotlin-gradle-plugin`.

## 3. Add plugins

There are two ways to add the dependencies, let's try the first one.

### 2.1 Informative way

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.2.21"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'kotlin'
```

Seems lots of things going on here, but in fact, it's just that easy.

The first one is `buildscript`, it only controls dependencies for the `buildscript` process itself, not for the application code. Which means it will add the dependencies for this building session itself, which properly gonna help you to finish some tasks.

And inside it. We want a plugin `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin` as our `dependencies`. It's in one of the `repositories` called `mavenCentral`. And then you just need to `apply` them.

If you feel uncomfortable about this, then here is some real news to make you calm. 99% plugin author will give you this full code, you just need to copy and paste. :D

### 2.2 Simplier way

The above way applies to the plugin which uses `maven central` to publish. And some plugins will also use `plugin portal` and it results in a simplified way.

```groovy
plugins {
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm" version "1.2.21"
}
```

That's it, no `buildscript` and `apply`. You use the `plugins` DSL to add plugin dependencies. Much cleaner. But consider it's still [incubating](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/feature_lifecycle.html) and maybe change in the future, not all plugins are available in this way. But I'm sure it's the future.

## 4. Configure the plugin

We have said that you need to copy and paste the `configuration block` of the plugin in order to customize it to your own needs. And by saying `configuration block`, I mean something like this:

```groovy
commandYouWantToUse {
    // Here is your settings
}
```

And another term to call this is `XXX DSL`, because it's a DSL which specific for settings. It will be put in your `build.gradle` file, just in the body of the file, not inside other blocks, and of course not `buildscript {}`. How to config? Easy, read their document.

And no matter which plugin you gonna use, their configurations all look identical to the above.

Let's say that we want to see more information when the compiler is working. We just need to add something like this:

```groovy
compileKotlin {
    kotlinOptions.verbose = true
}
```
Just that easy.

## 5. Add the dependencies of your project

Now we need to add the dependencies of your application code, which you need to add, so when the building phase happens, they will be included. You will see something pretty familiar:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.2.21"
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'
}
```

You define where to find the package, and you define the name of the package. They are different from the `dependencies` above. That `dependencies` need to reside inside the `buildscript {}` while this one just sits in the body of gradle. The `testCompile` command is for the libraries that you will use for the testing phase.

## 6. Configure the project information

This part is easy, most of the time, it's just as simple as declare some variables. Let's say we want to set up the `groupId` and `version` for our project. You just declare the following 2 variables:

```groovy
group 'myProject'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
```

In terms of what kind of variables you can and need to declare here, you can still find this information in the `plugin` document. That's very straightforward.

If they need that, they will tell you. And if you need to customize that, you just add. Otherwise, don't bother.

## 7. End

That's it. Hope it helps. And any time you see any `configuration block` that you don't know, just google that. It must be either from `gradle` itself or some plugin. You can check the official gradle document for more `configuration block` that you could use. Or, to be honest, most of the time, like most of the gradle user, you don't need, just find that plugin that most people use and adopt that, then you are good to go.
